# Alternative to React Navigation Drawer

Working on a project for a client I encountered a bug with react-navigation. When the user navigates to any screen from side drawer the screen got stuck and the user has to press the back button twice to perform any other action.

Unfortunately, I did not fount any working solution so I decided to make a way around.

By using these two libraries I created similar native drawer behavior

 - **react-native-swipe-gestures**
 - **react-native-drawer**
